# Passifier

Generate Apple Passbook passes in Ruby

Passifier does most of the hard work and will more easily allow you to automate generating pkpass files. You simply supply

* A Hash of metadata and layout (the contents of pass.json for those experienced)
* Image URLs and paths
* The location of your key and certificate .pem files
* Output path where you'd like the generated .pkpass file

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'passifier'
```

## Usage

### Metadata and Layout

First, supply a bunch of pass information and styling.  This will become the file pass.json within the pass archive.  More information on pass.json and creating a layout can be found at [developers.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Reference/PassKit_Bundle/Chapters/Introduction.html).

```ruby

serial_number = "SO_SERIAL"

spec = {
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "passTypeIdentifier": "pass.example.example",
  "teamIdentifier": "METS",
  "relevantDate": "2012-07-30T14:19Z",          
  "organizationName": "Example Inc.",
  "serialNumber": serial_number,
  "description": "The example pass from README.md",
  "labelColor": "rgb(122, 16, 38)",
  "backgroundColor": "rgb(227, 227, 227)",
  "foregroundColor": "rgb(110,110,110)",
  "generic": {
    "headerFields": [
      {
        "key": "date",
        "label": "Date",
        "value": "October 30th"
      }
    ],
    "primaryFields": [
      {
        "key": "title",
        "label": "",
        "value": "Passifier!"
      }
    ],
    "secondaryFields": [
      {
        "key": "host",
        "label": "Host",
        "value": "paperlesspost.com",
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Images

Specify a Hash of images. Notice that you can use either paths or urls here.

```ruby

assets = {
  "background.png": "assets/background.png",
  "background@2x.png": "assets/background@2x.png",
  "icon.png": "assets/icon.png",
  "icon@2x.png": "assets/icon@2x.png",
  "logo.png": "http://i.imgur.com/WLUf6.png",
  "logo@2x.png": "http://i.imgur.com/mOpQo.png",
  "thumbnail.png": "assets/thumbnail.png",
  "thumbnail@2x.png": "assets/thumbnail@2x.png"
}
```

### Signing

Give Passifier some info about your `.pem` files.

To get your certificates and keys in order, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the iOS Provisioning Portal, add a Pass Type ID, download the certificate
2. Add the `.cer` file you're given to your keychain
3. Right click on the certificate, export it to `Certificates.p12`, create a secure password when prompted
4. `openssl pkcs12 -in Certificates.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out certificate.pem -passin pass:<THAT_SECRET_PASSWORD>`
5. `openssl pkcs12 -in Certificates.p12 -nocerts -out key.pem -passin pass:<THAT_SECRET_PASSWORD> -passout pass:<ANOTHER_SECRET_PASSWORD>`

Download the [Worldwide Developer Relations](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/)
certificate and export it as a `.pem` file to include in the signature.

```ruby
key_pem = "path/to/a/key.pem"
pass_phrase = "<ANOTHER_SECRET_PASSWORD>"
cert_pem = "path/to/a/certificate.pem"
wwdr_pem = "path/to/the/wwdr_certificate.pem"

# Create a Signing object
signing = Passifier::Signing.new(key_pem, pass_phrase, cert_pem, wwdr_pem)
```

### Generate!

Now it's time to create your pass.

```ruby
Passifier::Pass.generate("readme.pkpass", serial_number, spec, assets, signing)
```

Passifier will have created the file `readme.pkpass` for you.  When opened in Passbook, that pass looks something like:
